# Changelog

All notable changes to claude-honcho will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.5] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Memory statusLine — surfaces what Honcho memory is doing on the Claude Code statusLine. Hooks write a per-window activity-state file (`~/.honcho/state-<session>.json`) and a host-managed renderer (`plugins/honcho/scripts/honcho-statusline.sh`) draws sync status, a clickable session link, and a live activity glyph (loading/compacting/recalling/querying). Installed and registered by `/honcho:setup`; toggle on/off via the `statusline` config key, settable through `/honcho:config`.
- First-prompt tool hint — on the first prompt of a session, nudges the harness to actively call the Honcho MCP tools rather than rely only on passive context injection.
- Per-host `apiKey` field in `hosts.<name>` — takes precedence over root `apiKey`, still overridden by `HONCHO_API_KEY` env var. Lets different integrations authenticate against different Honcho orgs from one config file.
- `get_config` now warns when `HONCHO_API_KEY` is set and overrides the `apiKey` in `config.json`, so the active key is never ambiguous.
- Version-update nag: warns on first prompt when the installed plugin is behind the published version (checks for updates at most once a day; silent on failure).
- `scripts/analyze-usage.py` — analyzes Claude Code Honcho usage from `~/.claude` logs.

### Changed

- Skip `cd` commands when logging Bash tool calls

### Fixed

- Spinner degrades gracefully without a TTY — Claude Code >=2.1.139 runs hooks without a controlling terminal, so `/dev/tty` fails; probe for a real terminal and fall back to a single clean line when none is available.
- `sessionStart` hook now runs async (#43).
- Preserve a host-scoped `apiKey` already on disk when rewriting config — no longer drops `hosts.<host>.apiKey` on save.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- `observationMode: "unified" | "directional"` config flag — per-host with root fallback, default `"unified"`
  - **unified** (default): all agents contribute to the user's self-observation collection (`observer=user, observed=user`); conclusions are portable across agents
  - **directional** (opt-in): each AI maintains its own view of the user (`observer=aiPeer, observed=user`); useful for isolated multi-agent workspaces
  - Resolves the ambiguity from issue #22 — prior code was implicitly directional with no user control; peer-call routing in all hooks and MCP tools now branches on this flag
- `get_context` MCP tool — retrieves the full context object (representation + peer card), scoped by observation mode
- `get_representation` MCP tool — lightweight representation string fetch, scoped by observation mode
- `list_conclusions` MCP tool — paginated list of saved conclusions with `id`, `content`, and `createdAt`
- `delete_conclusion` MCP tool — remove a conclusion by ID
- `schedule_dream` MCP tool — trigger background memory consolidation; Honcho merges redundant conclusions and derives higher-level insights
- `search` tool `scope` parameter — `"session"` (default) or `"workspace"` to search across all sessions
- `observationMode` settable via `set_config` and visible in `get_config` output and status card

### Fixed

- `aiPeer` peer config: `observeMe` corrected to `false` — agent peers don't need self-representation; eliminates wasted background reasoning compute
- `addPeers` session config: `aiPeer.observeOthers` is now `false` in unified mode and `true` in directional mode (was unconditionally `true`)

### Changed

- Bump `@honcho-ai/sdk` floor to `^2.1.0` (adds pagination, `getMessage`, `createdAt`/`isActive` on peers/sessions, strict validation)
- Bump `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` floor to `^1.26.0`

## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed

- Adding peers to session with config
- Windows compatibility for TTY, setup, and install
- Per-host config ownership, `saveRootField`, SDK client options
- Resilient hook lifecycle: phased session-end, cache-first user-prompt

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- Fix `chat-instance` session strategy ignoring `sessionPeerPrefix` setting — sessions now correctly prefix with peer name when enabled

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- Global `~/.honcho/config.json` with per-host config blocks (Claude Code, Cursor, Obsidian)
- Host auto-detection via environment signals (`HONCHO_HOST`, `CURSOR_PROJECT_DIR`)
- Linked workspaces for cross-host context sharing at runtime
- `/honcho:config` skill with `get_config` and `set_config` MCP tools
- `/honcho:setup` skill for first-time API key validation and config creation
- Multiple session strategies: `per-directory`, `git-branch`, `chat-instance`
- `globalOverride` flag to apply flat config fields across all hosts
- `sessionPeerPrefix` option to prefix session names with peer name

### Fixed

- Stale cache fallback with timeout for context fetch
- Clear stale session overrides when prefix/strategy/peerName changes
- Message sync bugs: dedup uploads, scope instance IDs per-cwd, add createdAt
- Chat-instance strategy ignores stale session overrides
- Respect `HONCHO_WORKSPACE` env var during legacy config migration
- Various config menu UX improvements (single-select link/unlink, granular host toggles)

### Changed

- Extracted `initHook()` for shared hook entry points
- Unified aiPeer defaults across hosts
- Renamed host identifier from `claude-code` to `claude_code`
- Skills synced to marketplace directory where plugin loader reads them

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- Configurable file logging to `~/.honcho/` (on by default, togglable)

### Changed

- Pinned `@honcho-ai/sdk` to `~2.0.0`
